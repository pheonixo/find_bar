/* codeset is either at device driver level or middle man between device driver

 * internally. Keyboard read in, or converted to UTF-8. Display 'file' converted
 * from UTF-8 to whatever set up of display driver. Hard-drive and the like
 * get converted to codeset (assume user porting to another system that only
 * works in that codeset). Could actually store UTF-8 on fixed drives, codeset
 * on external or plugable drives.

/* issue: current design didn't work as I wanted.
 * Wanted user to:
 *  inputs: codeset stream (really should have been a void * ? see below) with size in terms of "char" units
 *  inputs: unicode stream (always of size uint32_t with size_t in terms of code uints (32bit count))
 *
 *  code set stream is char * because code set stream and size could be wide chars
 *  which I believe at this point is a compiler setting of "char" defined as uint16_t
 *
 *  outputs: return was pointer to next read or write location of code set stream.
 *           from this one could continue work on locales code set and determine
 *           strlen of code set stream read/written. Error was returned by
 *           either no pointer advancement or unicode stream pointer pointing
 *           to error code indicator value.
 *
 *  design:  locale to locale is locale to unicode, work in system in unicode terms,
 *           then output in other/same locale's usage.
 *           A void to void shouldn't work as this becomes a specific use, non-inclusive.
 *           Code set's stream lengths read or written was pointer subtraction.
 *           Stream endpoints are to be returned for any operation needed, such
 *           as error handling, stream merging.
 *
 *  issue:   (One). Error indicator was only on code set to unicode, but user
 *           does not receive a last write position of unicode.
 *           (Two). Wanted both input streams to be able to determine stream
 *           read/written lengths to be determinable and both being able to pick
 *           up from left off point. This was not handled correctly! This was
 *           shied from because did not want void * use nor handle (**) use. I
 *           had hoped (mistakenly) to get this done in this current prototype.
 *
 *  solutions:  (one) use handles (**) to return both stream end points and return
 *           error code or boolean error occurred.
 *           (two) create a struct return with end points, error condition, and
 *           any future needed data
 * thoughts: on (one), would like handles to be reserved for returned allocations
 *           of objects. Plus that would lead to special user handling of pointers
 *           entry and exit.
 *           on (two), removes solution one's concerns, plus could alter param
 *           return to counts instead of pointers, or do both, or return any
 *           future info created due to design changes, like maybe a scan for
 *           specific code point during read/writes. Errors could become specific,
 *           such as, termination due to buffer size_t limits or invalid code vs
 *           not a unicode code, or termination on EOS (nul). Let's assume I am
 *           wrong about wchar, a state could be returned, largest code set bytes
 *           per code. I do NOT want param in and param out. Like idea of simplicity
 *           since this makes user programming, expansion, and debugging easier and
 *           less error prone.
 *
 * implementation: decided on (two). Need two pointers and error state. Pointers
 *           should be: first slot, Unicode pointer, second slot, code set pointer
 *           then error. This could be instead write pointer first, read pointer
 *           second, just as prototype arguments are write info then read info.
 *           
 *           The write/read setup would allow for special "locale_t" a FILE like
 *           struct where maybe locale to locale shortcuts could be used for
 *           both encoder/decoder operations and possible operations as loading
 *           a locale from file. This would structure a design concept allowing
 *           for easy operation design rather then reading manual to work
 *           each operation.
 *
 *           Still do not want to go with the void * since size_t for Unicode
 *           would always have math to break into "char" units. uint32_t can
 *           lead to optimizations and speciality writers can alter internally
 *           a known just like an unknown. The "char *" stays, rather than
 *           "unsigned char *" for convention, less typing, easy to typecast
 *           internally if needed.

/*
 * Since trying to distinguish the code set routines, return
 * struct should prefix with "cs". Suffix has been trying to
 * distinguish by me as "_t" (type) as scalar object, and
 * "_st" (struct type) for non-scalar. So returned object
 * should be "csXxxxx_st". wchar_t was initially used for unicode
 * but depends on user. ISO/IEC TR 19769 is trying for char16_t
 * and char32_t. This object really deals with encoding, decoding
 * so neither "types" should  be in object name.
 * covert or transform is actually the best description for
 * encode/decode. so xform, cvrt ? transform I think mathematics,
 * convert, one state to another. CNVRT.

/* notes:
 * On csSI, does not check if paired. This could be a single
 * code point entry used as a signal, or even a private use on some
 * other encoding scheme.
 * Similarly, csUU terminates on > 10FFFF, a code point greater might
 * be a different encoding scheme, or a signal.
 */
/* cs_rd: if cs_code is an early termination error,
 * cs_rd will point to offending object, byte or sequence.
 * cs_rd will point to read location, or just after the
 * nul stream terminator. If nul is to be included as part of
 * the stream, caller should check if nul termination happened
 * and continue with another call to encode/decode until desired
 * termination condition is met. On nul termination, cs_rd points
 * just after nul, as does cs_wr. So if joining reads into
 * a single write stream, decrement write pointer, change read pointer
 * to next stream to combine. Note that a different encoding scheme
 * can even be joined together. If incomplete code at end of stream,
 * move remaining stream to buffer beginning add rest of stream behind
 * last remaining unit(s) in buffer.
 */
/* On csNUL, behavior defined as:
 *   stream pointers end at nul,
 *   counters are not advanced.
 * Resets placed here, rcsNUL encode/decode exit code match up.

 *
 * This makes wchar_t rountines a wrapper allowing wchar_t to be the
 * abstract object encoding scheme for any codeset. This makes routine
 * codeset size largest to wchar_t is converting unit size to wchar_t
 * sizes. A four byte code must byte swap to either a 32bit wchar_t or
 * byte swap to 64bit. Big endian handles differently than little endian.
 * If things are as is, wchar_t defined by POSIX must be at least 8bits, but
 * can be up to "long" which now floats between 32 and 64 bits.
 * If sizeof(wchar_t) is 8bit then UTF-16 and UTF-32 must be converted to
 * 8bit streams. If wchar_t is 32bit then UTF-16 must convert to 32bit.
 *
 * So any wchar_t rountine is:
 *    If wchar_t input, convert wchar_t input to code set units.
 *    If wchar_t output, convert code set units to wchar_t output.
 * Could have for a given machine a table of function pointers
 * converting wchar_t to 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, 64bit
 * converting 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, 64bit to wchar_t
 * these would be machine specific and wchar_t specific.
