# find_bar
First ever find bar interface for Linux. This is not a search entry.


  This creates demo/design program showing off first ever find bar for
text editors. This also includes how to design your own buttons, labels,
and the creation of an actual text editor. The text editor is far from
complete. The DnD is internal only.
  I've included lci_findport files. This shows the connections to make
use of a find bar using Gtk. It creates a find bar intended to
mount atop a textview area. It provides find and replace abilities for
a text buffer.
